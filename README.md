A polished UI shell for orchestrating multi-model AI workflows. The interface highlights
routing playbooks, governance controls, and a curated roster of leading AI platforms.

### Highlights

- Cycle a capability filter to focus on model specialties.
- View live result counts and an empty-state hint when no model matches.

```
